<b>Conclustion</b>
<ul>
<li>Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel. Also the overall adr of City hotel is slightly higher than Resort hotel.</li>
<li>Mostly guests stay for less than 5 days in hotel and for longer stays Resort hotel is preferred</li>
<li>Both hotels have significantly higher booking cancellation rates and very few guests less than 3 % return for 
another booking in City hotel. 5% guests return for stay in Resort hotel.</li>
<li>Most of the guests came from european countries, with most no. of guest coming from Portugal.</li>
<li>Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO</li>
<li>For hotels higher adr deals come via GDS channel, so hotels should increase their popularity on this channel.</li>
<li>Almost 30% of bookings via TA/TO are cancelled.</li>
<li>July- August are the most busier and profitable months for both of hotels.</li>
<li>For customers, generally the longer stays (more than 15 days) can result in better deals in terms of low adr.</li>
<ul>
  
**Solution to Business Objective**
<ul>
<li>Majority of the hotels booked are city hotel. Definitely need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.</li>
<li>We should also target months between May to Aug. Those are peak months due to the summer period.</li>
<li>Majority of the guests are from Western Europe. We should spend a significant amount of our budget on those area.</li>
<li>Given that we do not have repeated guests, we should target our advertisement on guests to increase returning guests.</li>
